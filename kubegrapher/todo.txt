Implementation
    1 - (5) Add additional resource types (Volume, StatefulSet, DaemonSet and so on)
    2 - (6) Delete additional resource types (Deployment, ReplicaSet, Service, ConfigMap)
    3 - (1) Interface to query the graph (GraphSubscriber)
        3.1 - RestfulAPI (Flask)
        3.2 - (1) Database connection via Neo4j Python driver and Cypher
        3.3 - Pub/Sub interface
    4 - (7) Add support for Modified event type
    5 - (3) Write docker files for KubeGrapher, KubeInsights
    6 - (4) Write manifest file for all three
    7 - (2) Release the source code (April 4)

Design
    1 - Add hypervisor support to the graph
    2 - Identify cloud offering that we want to cover (so far its something like aws EKS)
    3 - Adding monitization with Smart Contracts and strengthening the DLT case with proof of computation and so on


What's the problem of using a uuid generated from KubeInsights?

    This uuid followed the lifecycle of the KubeInsights instance, but not the lifecycle of the cluster.
    If the KubeInsights instance died, and be re-runned, the uuid changed.
    Although we can add some data-persistence mechanism to keep this consistency, but overall, this 
    consistency still cannot match the lifecycle of a cluster, because the concept of the lifecycle 
    of a cluster is somehow unclear, I think.

How to Identify a cluster?

    It is like the Ship of Theseus. 
    Inside our cluster, a worker node can be added, be removed, and we can even migrate a master node.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57163698/how-to-move-kubernetes-master-node-from-one-server-to-another

    In the design of kubernetes, it seems that nodes are not aware of which cluster it belongs to, 
    which brings difficulties for multi-cluster management. 
    There is a clear illustration of Pod's lifecycle in k8s' documentation, but I cannot find clues of 
    the 'lifecycle' of a cluster.

    Please refer to this issue:
    https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44954
    And please see the proposed API KEP-2149: ClusterId for ClusterSet identification
    https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-multicluster/2149-clusterid#clusterproperty-crd
    
Suggestions:

    a.  We can overcome this problem by adding ClusterProperty CRD in our kubernetes cluster.
        Then we can make use of the concept of clusterSet, and use About-API to identify a cluster.
        https://multicluster.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/about-api/

    b.  Instead we try to maintain the information of a cluster in our Grapher.

    c.  We identify each node's ownership by using labels.
